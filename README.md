# Prompt Saver Chrome Extension

## Description

The Prompt Saver Chrome Extension is a handy tool that simplifies the process of saving, managing, and using AI prompts directly within your Google Chrome browser. It offers a set of features designed to enhance your workflow when working with AI models.

## Features

### Display Saved Prompts

The extension provides a visually appealing list of saved prompts. Each saved prompt is displayed as a "prompt card" with a title and text.

### Copy to Clipboard

You can easily copy the text of any saved prompt to your clipboard by clicking on the prompt card. This feature streamlines the process of using prompts in your AI projects.

### Save New Prompts

The extension allows you to save new prompts. When you save a prompt, you can provide both a title and the text of the prompt. This makes it easy to organize and categorize your prompts.

### "Copied" Message

When you copy a prompt to your clipboard, a "Copied" message briefly appears to confirm the successful copy operation. This feedback ensures you know when the copy is complete.

### Persistence

All saved prompts are stored locally using the browser's `localStorage`. This means your prompts are accessible across browser sessions and even after you close and reopen your browser.
